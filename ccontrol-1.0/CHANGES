Changes for 1.0
---------------
Configuration language changes:
	- config file now called ~/.ccontrol/config not default
	- '= off' now replaced with 'disable', can be used in more places
	- 'parallel' keyword gone: use 'no-parallel disable'
	- 'no-parallel' by itself no longer valid, use 'no-parallel = *'
	- 'nice' keyword to change priority
	- 'lock-file' keyword to have some builds not block others.
	- Paths (include, distcc, etc) expand ~ so you can use "~/bin/gcc".
	- Unknown argv[0] is passed through, so you can ccontrol anything.
	

Changes for 0.9
---------------
New features:
	- Gnome panel control-area applet which sets symlink

Other changes:
	- Fix PowerPC (and other?) locking (patch from Tony Breeds)
	- Intercept ccache misses, so we don't have to guess chance of hit
	- Fix error reporting (also patched by Olof Johansson)

Changes for 0.8
---------------
Other changes:
	- fix bug where all complations done at once if distcc failed.
	- invoking ccontrol by itself gives current settings.
	- invoking ccontrol -V/--version gives current version.
	- debian packaging
	- fix bug where ccontrol didn't reread config file when re-symlinked

Changes for 0.7
---------------
Configuration language changes:
	- "add make" to add makefile arguments (eg. for cross-compiling).

Other changes:
	- ccontrol can now be invoked with --section= for special effects.
	- Faster response to config changes if distcc fails.
	- Examples and troubleshooting in documentation

Changes for 0.6
---------------
Configuration language changes:
	- distc++-hosts for c++ compiles (defaults to distcc-hosts)
	- parallel keyword to override no-parallel
	- distcc only used if distcc-hosts/distc++-hosts set

Other changes:
	- toplevel make now shouldn't queue behind other makes.

Changes for 0.5
---------------
Configuration language changes:
	- off keyword for distcc and ccache to turn them off locally

Other changes:
	- ccontrol: "cannot decrement semaphore" fixed: support multiple users.
	- distcc: detect when distcc is failing, don't flood localhost.
	- documentation: fix cpus entry in ccontrol(1)
	- ccontrol-init: human names, fix some failure cases
	- ccache: don't limit distcc so hard when ccache enabled
	- install: create directories if necessary

Changes for 0.4
---------------
IMPORTANT: Configuration language changes:

	- "parallel" renamed to "cpus" (other was confusing)

	- "[global]" must be replaced by "[*]": we now process *every*
	  matching section, in order.

Other changes:
	ccontrol-init: better handling for probing distcc hosts
	configuration: "include" keyword for including files
	documentation: clarifications, hacking advice, license
	distribution: include .hg dir to help users become developers
	users: ccontrol now has a second user (and developer)
