ccontrol (0.9.1+20071204-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The symlinks provided in /usr/lib/ccontrol for alternate compiler versions
  don't actually execute the alternate compiler unless ccontrol config files
  are updated to point to the enclosing directory, eg.
    cc = /usr/bin
  instead of
    cc = /usr/bin/gcc

  The ccontrol-init(1) program will now generate config files pointing to the
  enclosing directory so the correct program will be found.

  This is currently a Debian extension. See bug #447832 for details.
