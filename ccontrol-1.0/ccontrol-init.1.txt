NAME
----
ccontrol-init - initialize ccontrol setup

SYNOPSIS
--------
'ccontrol-init' [file]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The ccontrol-init(1) program creates a sensible default configuration
file for ccontrol, and then installs ccontrol in your $HOME/bin
directory if you have one (otherwise, you can simply put
/usr/lib/ccontrol early in your path).  If no filename is specified on
the command line, $HOME/.ccontrol/default is used.

If $DISTCC_HOSTS is set, then that is used as the distcc host list,
otherwise a simple scan of the local network is attempted to find
likely hosts.
